#Title: Automatic Clothes Segregator

##This group project was done in third year(5th semester) of B.Tech.

##Research paper of this project was presented in NCIET 2024 held at AISSMS CoE, Shivajinagar, Pune on 13 Aug 2024.

###Project Overview: Washing machines are an integral part of day-to-day life. In the washing machine, if coloured and white clothes are washed together, there is the possibility to mix colours. Colour segregation is needed for washing machines to resolve this issue. The proposed system introduces an Automatic Clothes Segregator that employs the TCS3200 colour sensor and Arduino Uno microcontroller as fundamental components. The Automatic clothes segregator operates on the TCS3200 sensor and detects the colour of incoming garments, converting light intensity into digital signals processed by the Arduino Uno controller. Upon analysis, the controller initiates segregation, directing garments to designated compartments based on colour. Rigorous testing validates the system's reliability and accuracy, showcasing high precision in colour detection and segregation while accommodating a broad spectrum of colours. The proposed system holds significant promise for industries reliant on efficient sorting processes, including laundry services, garment manufacturing, and retail. Integrating advanced sensor technology and microcontroller systems is a transformative step towards automation, promising heightened productivity and resource optimization across diverse operational contexts.
